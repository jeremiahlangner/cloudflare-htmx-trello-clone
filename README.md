# HTMX Trello Clone

A serverless implementation of the HTMX trello clone developed by rajasegar (github.com/rajasegar/htmx-trello).

## Why

rajasegar's Heroku instance of this server example for HTMX with node.js is down.

## Usage

## Why No Tests (right now)?

This is a proof of concept project. I am actively architecting and developing it in real time. Tests are very beneficial once an API has been cemented (i.e. there has been a lot of adoption, or the parameters for use are well established) while a project is still being designed, they will inhibit productivity. I prefer a "design by doing" approach. I often will not know what problems will need to be solved until I encounter them for a specific project. TDD can't apply well in this situation.

## Attribution

This project is developed with a large amount of debt to the code written by Rajasegar Chandran. He is included as a copyright holder in the license per ISC specifications in the original project, though this code itself is not a direct fork.
